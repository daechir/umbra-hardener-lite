## Purpose
Umbra Hardener Lite serves as a custom automated hardening script to further lockdown Windows 10 systems by:
+ Removing Microsoft bloatware.
+ Removing frequently unused features.
+ Disabling numerous preinstalled system services.
+ Hardening the network stack.
+ Customizing the UI.


## Origin
Umbra Hardener Lite is the child of [Umbra Hardener](https://github.com/daechir/umbra-hardener) which is now discontinued.<br/>
The original Umbra Hardener was discontinued because it became too large for a single person to maintain.<br/>
Moreover certain features like Cortana, Telemetry and etc are a constantly moving target with Microsoft changing them almost every new Windows version.<br/>
Compared to its parent Umbra Hardener Lite is roughly 500-800 lines smaller and does just as much.


## Guidelines:
My recommendation is to use this script on a "debloated", "lite" or "superlite" Windows 10 ISO (Ones with bloat, telemetry and etc already removed).<br/>
An example ISO you could use is [GHOST á´» Spectre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoEmy0IVvy8).<br/>
Choose your ISO wisely as some may contain a backdoor, a undetectable rootkit, some other form of malware or even keyloggers.<br/>
After you've chosen a ISO and installed it on your system then run this script.<br/>
Afterwards you should also run a privacy tool like [O&O ShutUp10](https://www.oo-software.com/en/shutup10).
