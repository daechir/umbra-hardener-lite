## Purpose
Umbra Hardener Lite serves as a custom automated hardening script to further lockdown Windows 10 systems by:
+ Removing Microsoft bloatware.
+ Removing frequently unused features.
+ Hardening the network stack.
+ Customizing the UI.


## Origin
Umbra Hardener Lite is the child of [Umbra Hardener](https://github.com/daechir/umbra-hardener) which is now discontinued.<br/>
Compared to its parent Umbra Hardener Lite is roughly 800-1000 lines smaller.


## Guidelines:
My recommendation is to use this script on a "debloated", "lite" or "superlite" Windows 10 ISO (Ones with telemetry removed and etc).<br/>
An example iso you could use is [Ghost n Spectre ISO's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiUsCRw_cxsod_ZQ-ebDxTQ).
