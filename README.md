## Purpose
Umbra Hardener Lite serves as a custom automated hardening script to further lockdown Windows 10 systems by:
+ Removing Microsoft bloatware.
+ Removing frequently unused features.
+ Hardening the network stack.
+ Customizing the UI.


## Origin
Umbra Hardener Lite is the child of [Umbra Hardener](https://github.com/daechir/umbra-hardener) which is now discontinued.<br/>
Compared to its parent Umbra Hardener Lite is roughly 800-1000 lines smaller.


## Guidelines:
My recommendation is to use this script on a "debloated", "lite" or "superlite" Windows 10 ISO (Ones with telemetry removed and etc).
This will ensure that items like cortana are actually removed instead of relying on scripts or tools to temporarily disable them.
However, you may also use this on the official vanilla Windows 10 ISO's found on Microsofts website.
